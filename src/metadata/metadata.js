The project I was part of was in partnership with Gertec, a Brazilian company responsible for a large part of payment terminals in Brazil. The technological solution of the project was the construction of a mobile application focused on quality, as well as the creation of code documentation and unit testing. The application aimed to test all interfaces and functionalities of payment terminals automatically, quickly, and objectively. The project was successfully completed, resulting in a reduction of the testing time of each terminal by an average of 4 hours.
